## Numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations

These are the scripts I used in my thesis to test the order of convergence of two numerical schemes I studied, namely:
- the Implicit Euler scheme ([A. Alfonsi - 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3855))
- the split step scheme ([E. Moro, H. Schurz - 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220411528_Boundary_Preserving_Semianalytic_Numerical_Algorithms_for_Stochastic_Differential_Equations)) 
Tesing the schemes on the CIR process with multiple randomly selected coefficents, we obtained a strong and weak order of convergence 1.

Details about the results obtained and the algorithms employed are available in my thesis.
